We present **Biological Large Language Model for Protein-Protein Interaction prediction**, abbreviated as **BioLLM-PPI**. This innovative framework leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret and analyze protein sequences and interactions through a natural language processing lens. 

## Key Features of BioLLM-PPI

- **Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT) Method**: BioLLM-PPI introduces the Protein Chain of Thought (ProCoT) method, transforming the complex, structured data of protein interactions into intuitive, natural language prompts. 

- **Enhanced Predictive Accuracy**: This approach not only facilitates a deeper understanding of protein functions and interactions but also enhances the model's predictive accuracy by incorporating protein-specific embeddings and instruction fine-tuning on domain-specific datasets.
